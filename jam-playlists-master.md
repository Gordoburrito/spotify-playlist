## Playlist Philosophy

These playlists capture three distinct moods within jam band music, all inspired by the conversation about the Grateful Dead's legendary Cornell 5/8/77 show (often called the best Dead show ever recorded).

**The Conversation That Inspired These:**
> "For music similar to that classic Grateful Dead live sound, here are some great directions to explore..."

The playlists prioritize:
- âœ… **Live versions** whenever possible (that exploratory energy!)
- âœ… **Extended jams** and improvisation
- âœ… **Varied eras** - from 1960s/70s classics to modern jam bands
- âœ… **Thoughtful flow** - each playlist builds and evolves
- âœ… **Deep cuts and essentials** - not just the obvious choices
